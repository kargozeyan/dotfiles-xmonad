# Dotfiles
Here you can find the dotfiles for my latest setup on the Xmonad. Feel free to create an issue if I'm missing something.

NOTE: These dots are intended for my setup. Thus, if you wish to use them, you will have to make specific modifications for your own machine. I'll do my best to answer questions related to parameters that may need to be changed.
